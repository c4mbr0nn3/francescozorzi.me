# My LittleLink

This is my personal fork of the great [LittleLink](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink) project.

It has some tweaks to the CSS, new buttons available and a prettier config for proper code indentation. I will eventually propose these changes to the original project.

The project is deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) infrastructure, which is very similar to the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) solution recommended by the author. Again, it's just a matter of personal preference.

## What is LittleLink?

Quoting the author:

> LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee) and [many.link](https://www.google.com). LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplateâ€”we just stripped out some additional code you wouldn't need and added in branded styles for popular services. ðŸ˜Š
